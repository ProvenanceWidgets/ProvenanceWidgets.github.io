Script/Instructions for downloading the required dependencies and compiling the code:

1. Open a terminal on your machine and navigate to this project's top-level directory (i.e. where this file is).
2. Download and install node and npm by following the instructions from https://nodejs.org/en/download/. As noted in `package.json` > "engines", ProvenanceWidgets supports node 20.x LTS or newer and npm 10.x or newer. If you already have an incompatible version of node/npm, use a node version manager (e.g. https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm or https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) to switch to a supported version.
3. Install the compatible angular version using `npm install -g @angular/cli@15.2.9`
4. Install the required dependencies from package.json using `npm install`.
5. (Optional) - Build a production version of the project in the `/dist` folder using `npm run build`. This step is not required for running the project.

Script/Instructions for reproducing the results in the paper: Using the same terminal from the previous steps, run `npm run start`. The project should now be accessible on `localhost:4200`, provided the port is available. If not, the terminal will prompt you for making it accessible on the next available port.
